My name is Sean Bedford and I am a Solutions Specialist at [Empired](www.empired.com).  

Who knows where this blog will end up - I plan to blog about interesting solutions to problems I have encountered and give my opinion on technology issues but we'll see where we end up.

## Employment

I've just joined [Empired](www.empired.com) (April 2015), a Microsoft Gold Partner providing specialised consulting services to clients across Australia and New Zeland.  Empired offers services across Business Productivity Soltions (Dynamics CRM, AX, NAV), Collaboration and Content (SharePoint, Sitecore, etc) as well as IT managed services and application development and integration. 

I work in the Dynamics team as a Solution Specialist working with prospective and current customers to align business and technology decisions in the Dynamics and wider Microsoft stack. 

Previously,  I worked with Ajilon as a Solution Architect and Technical Team Lead for a number of projects on the Microsoft stack.  

I have also done my fair share of Pre-Sales activities which is always a challenge and very enjoyable.

Even further back I worked for [Asciano](www.asciano.com.au) as a System Architect and Technical Lead on the .NET development team.  I was responsible for designing solutions and leading the development team to deliver solutions for this ports and logistics businesses.

## Technology

My background is mainly in Microsoft technologies however I'll use whatever tools I have at my disposal to ensure a good outcome.

I have developed Web and Windows applications on the .NET Frameowrk since version 1.0 and have watched the platform mature and Microsoft evolve into the world class platform it is today.

I've had plenty of experience designing and implementing solutions on various business application platforms like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM, as well as Identity Management platforms like Active Directory and Forefront.  

The cloud provides many opportunities for developers and architects to position and deliver solutions.  My focus has mainly been on Azure however I have also designed and deployed solutions on AWS. 

## Personal

I'm from Sydney Australia, more specifically from [Maroubra](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Maroubra+NSW/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b12b3ce176e4569:0x5017d681632c000) in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs.

I've got 2 beautiful girls, Emily and Lucy who keep me pretty busy but when I can find the time I enjoy surfing, golfing and playing the guitar.

I'm also a mad [South Sydney Rabbitohs](www.rabbitohs.com.au) fan and can't wait to see if the boys can go back to back in 2015.

## This blog

I forked [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from Barry Clark to use as a base for this blog.  I've kind of customised the layout but it still needs a fair bit of work.  The source is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbedford/sbedford.github.io).
