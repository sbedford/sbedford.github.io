I'm a Solutions Architect who has been working professionally in Microsoft Technologies for over 10 years.

I've been working with [Ajilon](www.ajilon.com.au), a business and technology consulting company, for the last 5 years in a mixture of delivery and pre-sales roles.

## Family

I have a wife and two beautiful daughters; my eldest Emily has just started Primary School!

## Other stuff

I'm learning to play the guitar! I've had an acoustic guitar for over a year now and have just discovered Rocksmith....Rock on...
