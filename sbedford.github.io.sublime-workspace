Nuts to that.\n\nArmed with ScriptCS my goal was to build a small script which could easily extract the following in a word document:\n\n* All commits between two version tags provided as arguments\n* All Jira tickets referenced in the commits\n* Specific details (summary, components, epic) of the referenced Jira tickets\n* File diffs (not particularly useful but still...)\n\nThe script was pretty straight-forward really - using the following libraries to extract, interrogate and transform the data into the format that I needed. \n\n* [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp)\n* [JiraRestClient](https://github.com/techtalk/JiraRestClient)\n* [OpenXml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK)\n\nThe only problem that it didnt work, at least [not straight away](/open-source-done-right) due to [issues](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/913) with ScriptCS struggling to load the native assemblies required for the LibGit2Sharp nuget package.\n\nUsing LibGit2Sharp to extract the commits between the tags was pretty simply - find the tags, exectute a search and then consume the data.  The only gotcha was the ordering of the search parameters as you're walking backwards from the current HEAD of the repository:\n\n{% gist 860429cb21bdb1db586e commits.cs %}\n\nOnce I had the commits I was interested in extracting the Jira tickets was a snap (take that Awk!) and in no time I was using the JiraRestClient to retrieve the data I needed from the [Jira REST API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/).\n\n{% gist 860429cb21bdb1db586e Jiras.cs %}\n\nJiraRestClient comes with a predefined set of fields which are retrieved when you interrogate the API, however the list of Components (which we use to classify different areas of our systems) is not one of them.  Luckily, the API allows you to extend the [IssueFields](https://github.com/techtalk/JiraRestClient/blob/master/TechTalk.JiraRestClient/IssueFields.cs) class to de-serialise any of the additional information which is returned by the REST API:\n\n{% gist 860429cb21bdb1db586e IssueFieldsWithcomponent.cs %}\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was to export the data into a word document so it can be issued -  so it was back to the old faithful the OpenXml SDK.  Again, if you haven't played with this before go and have a look, it's a really neat framework for manipulating or creating documents or document fragments and it isn't limited to just Word documents.\n\nI've used OpenXml for a bunch of things over the years; from mass producing lab sample labels to automating database documentation and the process is pretty simple.\n\n1. Open the document\n2. Find and modify the elements youj want to change using the Queryable's provided.\n3. Do something with the output.\n\nThe tricky bit when dealing with OpenXml for me has always been tables - there isn't really a nice way to bind data in such a way that the rows are created automatically and the ordering of columns isn't so sensitive as it would be if you are manually adding rows and expecting columns to be a in a certain sequence.\n\nMy solution was to bind the columns of the table to the property names of the object through the text contained in the heading column:\n\n![Word Document Template Binding](/images/2015-02-08-git-jira-releasenotes-jiraticket.png \"[Word Document Template Binding\")\n\n{% gist 860429cb21bdb1db586e JiraIssueModel.cs %}\n\nThis solution works reasonably nicely as it allows the columns to be re-ordered or additional columns added without having to changed the script (unless we need to pull down more data from Jira)\n\n###Ideal Solution?\n\nWhen I started down this path I really wanted something just to replace the old bash script that had stopped working.  However by the end what I really wanted was something that was integrated into our build and deployment process to automate the whole process with the additional benefits of being able to retain the release notes _against_ the release in octopusDeploy.\n\nThats my ideal solution, but for now what I have is Good Enough.",
